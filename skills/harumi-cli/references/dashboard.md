# Dashboards & widgets

A Harumi project renders **one dashboard per repo-committed spec**, each bound by dot-path keys to `output/output.json` — the file a run writes (see `[output]` in `harumi.toml`). There is no dedicated backend endpoint for this: a dashboard spec is just a file in the project's Gitea repo, read with `harumi repo cat` / written with `harumi repo put`, same as any other file.

## Where dashboards live

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `dashboard/<name>.toml` | One dashboard each. Any number of them; alphabetical by filename. |
| `dashboard.toml` (repo root) | The original single-dashboard layout. Still supported, and shown **last**. |

When a project has more than one spec, the platform shows a **dashboard picker** dropdown above the run picker on both the project page and the public share link; a project with exactly one spec shows no picker and looks exactly as it did before the folder existed. Nested files (`dashboard/archive/old.toml`) are ignored, so a subfolder is how you keep a draft out of the picker.

Each dashboard's picker label comes from an optional top-level `title`, falling back to a prettified filename (`dashboard/machine-schedule.toml` → `Machine schedule`):

```toml
title = "Machine schedule"

[[widgets]]
# ...
```

A project with **no** spec at all still renders — the platform falls back to a generic default dashboard. `harumi projects create` gets a starter root `dashboard.toml` seeded server-side; `harumi import` does **not** (it overwrites the scaffold), so an imported project has no dashboard until one is committed.

To add a second dashboard to a project that has the root file, leave it alone and commit `dashboard/<name>.toml` — or move it (`harumi repo mv dashboard.toml dashboard/<name>.toml`) if you'd rather have every dashboard in one folder.

## The failure mode this exists to catch

The platform's parser (`parseDashboardConfig` in harumi-platform) is deliberately forgiving: a widget with an unknown `type`, a missing required key, or a renamed key (e.g. `valueKey` instead of `value_key`) is **silently dropped** — the dashboard renders everything else and the bad widget just doesn't appear, with no error surfaced to whoever edited the file. A widget whose dot-path doesn't resolve against a real run's `output.json` renders, but empty.

Always run `harumi dashboard validate` before `harumi repo put` (or before telling the user a dashboard edit is done) — it's the only place in the toolchain that fails loudly.

## The widget types

Get the live, in-code reference with `harumi dashboard widgets` (add `--type metric` to filter to one). Summary:

| type | required keys | optional keys |
|---|---|---|
| `metric` | `value_key` | `delta_key`, `format` (`number`\|`currency`\|`percent`), `unit` |
| `kpi-rail` | `items` | — (each item optionally: `rows_key`, `progress_key`, `tone`) |
| `table` | `rows_key`, `columns` | — |
| `detail` | `items_key`, `id_key` | `fields` |
| `filter` | `items_key`, `id_key` | `label_key` |
| `treemap` | `items_key`, `value_key`, `name_key` | `color_key`, `capacity_key` |
| `heatmap` | `items_key` | `resource_key`, `bucket_key`, `value_key`, `unit` |
| `chart` | `variant` (`line`\|`bar`), `data_key`, `x_key`, `series` | — |
| `line-chart` | `data_key`, `x_key`, `series` | — |
| `bar-chart` | `data_key`, `x_key`, `series` | — |
| `gantt-chart` | `tasks_key` | `resource_key`, `label_key`, `start_key`, `end_key`, `duration_key`, `color_key`, `time_unit` |
| `timeline` | `items_key` | `resource_key`, `label_key`, `start_key`, `end_key`, `duration_key`, `color_key`, `id_key`, `regions_key`, `region_start_key`, `region_end_key`, `region_label_key`, `region_resource_key`, `time_unit` |

`line-chart`/`bar-chart` and `gantt-chart` are deprecated in favor of `chart` (variant-based) and `timeline` respectively — kept only so a spec written before those existed keeps rendering; write new widgets against `chart`/`timeline` instead.

Every widget entry also needs `type`, `id` (unique), and `title`. `*_key` fields (except chart `x_key`/gantt's per-task field names) are **dot-paths into `output.json`**, e.g. `"totals.revenue"`.

### `metric` — a single KPI tile

```toml
[[widgets]]
type = "metric"
id = "revenue"
title = "Total revenue"
value_key = "totals.revenue"
format = "currency"
```

Matching `output.json`: `{"totals": {"revenue": 812300}}`.

### `kpi-rail` — several KPI tiles in one row

```toml
[[widgets]]
type = "kpi-rail"
id = "summary"
title = "Run summary"
items = [
  { label = "Cost", value_key = "totals.cost", format = "currency" },
  { label = "Makespan", value_key = "totals.makespan" },
]
```

Each item has its own `value_key`/`format`/`unit`, same as a standalone `metric`. Always renders in a pinned strip above every other widget, regardless of where it's declared in `[[widgets]]`.

An item can instead use `rows_key` in place of `value_key` — a dot-path to an array of rows, rendered as a per-entity `label / meter / value` list within that one tile instead of a single number:

```toml
{ label = "Utilization", rows_key = "machines", progress_key = "utilization_pct", tone = "warn" }
```

`rows_key` and `value_key` are mutually exclusive on one item — set one or the other, not both. `progress_key` names a field within each resolved row holding a 0–100 progress value (not validated as a dot-path the way `rows_key` itself is), drawn as a meter under the row's label/value; a row missing it renders with no meter. `tone` is one of `good`\|`warn`\|`bad`\|`neutral` and colors the meter/value — set on the item as a fallback, or on a row itself (a `tone` field within the row) to vary per entity.

### `table` — a sortable grid

```toml
[[widgets]]
type = "table"
id = "breakdown"
title = "Breakdown"
rows_key = "breakdown"
columns = [
  { key = "name", label = "Name" },
  { key = "value", label = "Value" },
]
```

Matching `output.json`: `{"breakdown": [{"name": "Item A", "value": 52400}]}`. `columns[].key` is a field **within each row object**, not a dot-path.

### `detail` — fields of the currently selected row

```toml
[[widgets]]
type = "detail"
id = "job-detail"
title = "Job details"
items_key = "jobs"
id_key = "id"
```

Shows the fields of whichever row is currently selected — via a `timeline` click, or a `filter` option — looked up by matching `id_key` against the selection id. Renders in a sidebar column, not the main grid.

### `filter` — a selection producer

```toml
[[widgets]]
type = "filter"
id = "job-picker"
title = "Pick a job"
items_key = "jobs"
id_key = "id"
label_key = "name"
```

One option button per distinct `id_key` value in `items_key`; clicking one drives the same selection a `timeline` click would. An alternative entry point into selection, not a data filter on other widgets. Renders in the sidebar, same as `detail`.

### `treemap` — proportional rectangles

```toml
[[widgets]]
type = "treemap"
id = "cost-breakdown"
title = "Cost by category"
items_key = "categories"
value_key = "cost"
name_key = "name"
```

Matching `output.json`: `{"categories": [{"name": "Materials", "cost": 41200}]}`. Rectangle area is proportional to `value_key`; `color_key` optionally groups rectangles into a categorical color. `capacity_key` is a dot-path to a total-capacity number — when the rows' summed `value_key` is less than this, a synthetic "Free" tile fills the remainder, so area doubles as a capacity gauge; omitted, or at/below the summed value, adds no tile.

### `heatmap` — entity x time-bucket grid

```toml
[[widgets]]
type = "heatmap"
id = "hourly-cycles"
title = "Cycles per hour"
items_key = "hourly_cycles"
resource_key = "resource"
bucket_key = "bucket"
value_key = "value"
```

Matching `output.json`: `{"hourly_cycles": [{"resource": "M1", "bucket": 8, "value": 42}]}`. One row per `(resource, bucket)` pair, shaded by `value_key` intensity; `resource_key`/`bucket_key`/`value_key` default to `resource`/`bucket`/`value` and are fields within each row, not dot-paths. A `(resource, bucket)` pair with no matching row renders as a distinct unavailable cell, not a zero — so a machine with no cycles logged for an hour looks different from one that logged zero.

### `chart` — line or bar, by `variant`

```toml
[[widgets]]
type = "chart"
id = "trend"
title = "Objective value over time"
variant = "line"
data_key = "timeseries"
x_key = "label"
series = [{ key = "value", label = "Objective value" }]
```

Matching `output.json`: `{"timeseries": [{"label": "Mon", "value": 412}, {"label": "Tue", "value": 398}]}`. `x_key` and `series[].key` are fields within each data point, not dot-paths. Multiple `series` entries render as multiple lines/bars. `variant = "bar"` renders the same shape as a bar chart.

### `line-chart` / `bar-chart` — deprecated, use `chart`

Same fields as `chart` minus `variant` — the variant is implied by `type` instead. Kept only for specs written before `chart` existed.

### `gantt-chart` — deprecated, use `timeline`

The shape for job-shop / scheduling solver output: one row per resource/machine, one bar per task.

```toml
[[widgets]]
type = "gantt-chart"
id = "schedule"
title = "Machine schedule"
tasks_key = "schedule"
time_unit = "min"
```

Matching `output.json`:

```json
{
  "schedule": [
    { "resource": "Machine 1", "task": "Job A op1", "start": 0, "end": 45 },
    { "resource": "Machine 1", "task": "Job B op1", "start": 45, "end": 90 },
    { "resource": "Machine 2", "task": "Job A op2", "start": 45, "end": 120, "group": "Job A" }
  ]
}
```

Semantics worth knowing:

- `resource_key`/`label_key`/`start_key`/`end_key` default to `resource`/`task`/`start`/`end` and are fields within each task object, not dot-paths.
- Set either `end_key` or `duration_key` (added to the start). If both are set, `end_key` wins. A task resolving neither is dropped from the chart.
- `color_key` names a field grouping tasks into a categorical color (e.g. tasks belonging to the same job).

`timeline` is the same shape plus more: fragmented tasks fold into one item with gaps (`id_key`), non-working spans render as background bands (`regions_key` + `region_*`), and a `[clock]` section (see below) drives a now-marker over it.

## Datasets, metrics, and the clock

Beyond `[[widgets]]`, a spec can declare three more top-level sections, all checked by `harumi dashboard validate` the same way a widget is — an invalid entry is reported and dropped, not silently rendered wrong:

- **`[[datasets]]`** — names a dataset's shape once instead of restating it per widget. Needs `id`, `kind` (`intervals`\|`records`\|`timeline`\|`scalars`), `source_key` (a dot-path into `output.json`), and a `[datasets.roles]` sub-table naming which fields play which role: `intervals` needs `start` plus `end` or `duration`; `timeline` needs `at` or `start` plus `value`; `records`/`scalars` need no roles at all.
- **`[[metrics]]`** — a KPI as a single read-only SQL query, run against the declared datasets and exposed to any widget under `metrics.<id>`. `sql` must be exactly one `SELECT`/`WITH`/`FROM`/`DESCRIBE`/`SUMMARIZE` statement — no writes, no `ATTACH`/`COPY`/`INSTALL`/`LOAD`/`PRAGMA`, and no table function that reads a path or URL (`read_csv`, `read_parquet`, `postgres_scan`, ...).
- **`[clock]`** — turns one `intervals` dataset into a play/pause/scrub transport bar over the schedule chart. `dataset` must name a declared `intervals` dataset, or (with no `[[datasets]]` entry needed) a `gantt-chart`/`timeline` widget's own id, suffixed `__source` (e.g. `dataset = "schedule__source"` for `id = "schedule"`) — its rendered schedule counts as an implicit `intervals` dataset. `speed` is optional and, if set, must be a positive finite number.

```toml
[[datasets]]
id = "schedule"
kind = "intervals"
source_key = "schedule"

[datasets.roles]
start = "start"
end = "end"

[[metrics]]
id = "makespan"
sql = "SELECT max(end) - min(start) AS value FROM schedule"

[clock]
dataset = "schedule"
speed = 30
```

## Layout

Both keys below are per-dashboard, at the top level of each spec:

```toml
title = "Cost breakdown"   # picker label; optional

[layout]
columns = 2
```

`columns` is the only layout hint; defaults to 2 when omitted.

## Validating

```bash
harumi dashboard widgets                           # the reference table above, always current
harumi dashboard validate                          # every ./dashboard/*.toml, else ./dashboard.toml
harumi dashboard validate ./dashboard/costs.toml   # just one spec
harumi dashboard validate --ref feature/solver-v2  # the repo's specs on a branch
harumi dashboard validate --against ./output.json  # + check dot-paths against a local file
harumi dashboard validate --latest                 # + check dot-paths against the latest run's output.json
harumi dashboard validate --run <RUN_ID>           # + a specific run
```

With no `PATH` it validates **every** spec it finds (locally, or in the repo with `--ref`), printing each filename as a heading, and exits non-zero if any spec would drop a widget, dataset, metric, or clock entry, isn't valid TOML, or (when checking dot-paths) would render a widget empty.
